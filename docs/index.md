## 🚀 Introduction

**Prism** acts as a powerful, jailed alternative to traditional jailbreaks, offering customizable icons, UI tweaks, lockscreen themes, and enhancements using sandboxed capabilities. Easily personalize and tune your iPhone without compromising security.

## ⚙️ Functionality

Prism unites Apple’s **Swift APIs** and **Shortcut Actions** to provide powerful customization. It uses app groups and the local documents folder for communication. While the helper shortcut is essential for Prism’s functionality, its impact on battery is barely noticeable.
